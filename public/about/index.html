<p>My name is Peter Östman and I&rsquo;m an IT professional with more than 20 years experience. Background in IT Infrastructure, architecture and security. Working with automation, cloud and devops. Living south of Stockholm - Sweden.</p>
<h2 id="the-blog">The Blog</h2>
<p>This blog will be about anything cloud, code, devops and IT in general, depending on what I work with at the moment and what is on my mind. I&rsquo;ll share knowledge on how to do things and my opinions related matters. I&rsquo;ll share both stuff I have learned and stuff I&rsquo;m still learning.</p>
<h2 id="my-story">My Story</h2>
<p>I started off my IT career as part of my studies in Network technology, right before the millenium shift with a work placement as an onsite IT support role in a multinational company. Worked with everything from workstation management, printers to Windows and Novell Netware servers, Network equipment and even some integration with mainframe and AS400.</p>
<p>Actually you could say my career started long before that, since was trying basic programming on my Commodore 64 at the age of 8 and when I got my first PC a few years later I customized a lot in DOS that later was replaced by windows. When I got my second PC, I also bought a modem, Internet had just emerged in Sweden, and my attention was split between Internet and traditional BBS servers - Bulleting Board System for those that are too young to remember what it was or simply never experienced it. A few years later Internet was publicly adopted in Sweden with the wide availabilty of DSL connections, and I built my own Gateway / Firewall running Redhat Linux, out of a 486 computer and some Network adapter cards I had laying around.</p>
<p>My second job was a second work placement in my final year of studying, at a small company, working with Windows and Linux servers and workstations. That job soon turned into a software development assignment, to write a new version of a number plan system for a telco provider. It was tough and my lack of experience in software developments (and the code was written with Oracle Power Objects, while I was trained in general Visual Basic) detered me from the software developer career path and to stick with network and server administration.</p>
<p>After my studies I was hired as a full time engineer for the company where I had my first work placement. A couple of years later I was transfered to IBM as part of a large outsourcing deal. From there my career accelerated, from onsite support guy to Server Administrator, cluster server expert and scripting guy on the Windows Server team in the IBM Sweden headquarters. Soon I tried out some project manager, solution manager and solution architect roles. I continued on the architect path for a couple of years, working with enterprise customers and soon I was doing architectural governance and solution reviews for other architects.</p>
<p>Then life made big turn, I met my wife, we had a son and during my paternity leave I had time to think. My passion at work has always been to use my creativity to design and build smart and useful solutions, doing it a bit hands-on and technical. Doing governance and politics as an architect in a huge company didn&rsquo;t really focus on that, I felt disconnected from the technology. I decided leave my employment after 9 years and take a step back into a Server Administrator role.</p>
<p>The new job was in an environment with strict security requirements. I learned a lot about IT security in a pretty deep level. Trying to find my niche in the team, I decided to dust off my scripting skills again - it had always served me well before. People told me to try out Powershell, since VBScript was getting out of fashion. I started making a few scripts for security purposes, at that time I had not yet understand how to work with objects in powershell so much was being done the old-fashioned way, parsing, string operations etc. Soon I started developing more and more scripts for management of the Windows server environment and Active Directory. That grew into making tools for the service desk, to reduce the amount of manual work for them. I got two colleagues that developed the same passion for Powershell as me, and we started exchanging skills and helping each other out. Suddenly every task we had to solve was turned into some sort of Powershell script exercise. Another colleague was working with puppet and I started opening my eyes to more aspects of the DevOps toolchain, up until then I didn&rsquo;t even know what DevOps was.</p>
<p>During that time we moved to a larger house and we had twins, increasing the family from 3 to 5. The new house was further away from my work and to avoid traffic I commuted awfully early in the mornings. A reorganisation at work divided the team and work sort of got less interresting. At the same time the world outside our air-gap environment there was cloud adoption gaining momentum in the world and I didn&rsquo;t want to miss that train. - It was time for a change.</p>
<p>I chose between two jobs, still in the Windows server space and powershell space and started a role as a Senior Engineer on a Windows Server team. Initially I was to take lead on the webserver platform, but when people saw me writing powershell I was quickly charged with taking over a lot of work from a consultant that had implemented SMA for the team. I spent the next two years writing runbooks, integrating with other teams and API&rsquo;s, providing powershell training, introducting the team to Git and TFS/Azure DevOps. In a very large environment with thousands of servers and technical debt, it&rsquo;s a slow and cumbersome journey. I built up some demos for <a href="https://ironmansoftware.com/powershell-universal/">Powershell Unviversal</a>, providing a front-end site for automated installation of new servers in the on-premises datacenters and made some some API endpoints for some use-cases. I also made some proof of concepts with Azure Automation instead of SMA, with on-prem hybrid workers and a CI/CD pipeline to sign and deploy the runbooks to Azure Automation.</p>
<p>However I still worked mainly with on-premises servers and still wanted to do all that stuff in the cloud, preferably Azure. There was a vacancy on the sister team, the cloud adoption team. Initially I didn&rsquo;t know if it was for AWS or Azure, I reasoned that any of the two would be a step in the right direction, even though Azure was an easier transition for me with my Microsoft product background and Powershell skills. I had a good reputation in the company and it was appreciated to make this internal move, rather than they would loose me, so I was soon getting the go-ahead.</p>
<p>It turned out the role would initially be about Azure and sometime in the future I might work on AWS as well&hellip;</p>
