      <description>When an organization decides to provision applications and infrastructure components in the cloud, security has to be taken into consideration. To mitigate human security mistakes it can be wise to put some guardrails around your cloud environments. The amounts of guardrails chosen depends on organisation size, developer experience level and security posture, as well as network topologies and possible connections to the on-premise company systems. In Azure, the Azure policies allow you to reduce the risk of having your environment being compromised by human error and risky configurations, either unintended or with malicious intent.</description>

      <description>In Azure, access and control of any resources is managed through Role based access control (RBAC). By being assinged a role, a user will be able to access or manage different aspects of a resource and it&amp;rsquo;s subordinate resources.

      <title>Deploying Azure Subscriptions, as Code</title>

      <description>An Azure Subscription is a boundary in Azure for billing and also an access management boundary. Usually a subscription has one or more owners that will have control over spending and assigning access to resources and resource groups in that subscription. In large organisations there may be a lot of development teams sharing the same Azure tenant, but each team may have one or more subscriptions in the tenant. That will separate their workloads and billing while still allowing them to share the user identities, some hub networking and other services that may be accessed through a hub network.</description>

      <description>When you get used to VSCode you will experience a boos to your productivity. Some repetitive tasks when writing code are drastically reduced, with language support, intellisense and more, you don&amp;rsquo;t even need to remember the syntax very well. Keyboard shortcuts is another important feature when coding, since you don&amp;rsquo;t want to take your hands off the keyboard to use the mouse too often.
Keyboard Shortcuts There is a keyboard shortcuts reference as https://code.</description>

      <title>Using Git version control in VSCode</title>
      <link>https://theautomationdude.github.io/blog/posts/gitinvscode/</link>

      <description>In a previous post I wrote about how to install git on the windows operating system. And another post was about how to get up and running with VSCode. This post will cover some basics on how to work with git, especially in VSCode.
To contribute to a software project, you can clone a repository and then push new code that you have authored to it. Normally this is done by working in different branches, where the main or master branch normally contains the version of the code that will be pushed to the production environment, while all developers work in other branches that get merged into the master/main branch.</description>

      <description>When you are authoring or editing any type of code or markdown text, VSCode can be a powerfull ally. It will give you syntaxt highlighting and intellisense for most modern programming languages and there is a wide set of extensions to make your life easier. If that wasn&amp;rsquo;t enough, VSCode also has built-in support for Git, meaning that you don&amp;rsquo;t need to learn all the Git commandline syntax and you get a visualization of your branches, commits, staged changes and stash.</description>

      <description>Whether you are developing applications, scripts or authoring Infrastructure As Code such as ARM, Bicep, Cloudformation, Google Cloud Deployment Manager or Terraform -templates, version control is important and at the heart of the DevOps toolkit. The most popular and widely adopted version control tool is Git, developed by Linus Torvalds â€“ the inventor of the Linux kernel.
If you work in VSCode, you won&amp;rsquo;t need to learn the git-cli commands, since VSCode has built-in support for git.</description>

      <title>How setup Powershell for Azure</title>

      <description>If you are using the Azure Cloud shell, you already have a useful powershell environment setup for you there by Microsoft&amp;hellip;
But it&amp;rsquo;s not that unusual that employers want to keep all your code in a repo that is company controlled and where your teammates can access your files, and that repo may not always be directly accessible from the cloud shell.
For that purpose, you might want to setup your own Powershell environment on the computer you work from.</description>
